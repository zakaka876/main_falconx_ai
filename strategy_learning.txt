Smart Money Strategy:
- Identify liquidity sweep (equal highs or equal lows taken out)
- Wait for Break of Structure (BOS) in the direction of sweep
- Look for Fair Value Gap (FVG) inside BOS leg
- Entry: Inside FVG with RSI divergence confirmation
- SL: Below swing low / Above swing high
- TP: At next liquidity zone (previous highs/lows)
- Use 21 EMA to confirm trend direction
- Avoid entries during low volume (confirmed by volume spike)
